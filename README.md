### [](https://github.com/pushpinderpalsingh/SpaceDash#a-dashboard-for-space)A Dashboard for Space...🚀🚀🚀 

SpaceDash is an open-source app that provides information on all the present, past, and future **launches and vehicles of SpaceX**. The SpaceDash app also includes news and updates regarding all vehicles and missions.

The app is currently in the second stage of development and several new features are being scoped/built. These features include an AR view of various vehicles of SpaceX and event updates from even more Space Agencies!

The project uses test-drive agile development processes, where requirements are turned into test cases, and code is improved upon. 

***Notice***

Currently, new version was not accepted by the App Store review team. Since there was recent update to the r/SpaceX API which caused our app to crash on launch and no way to update our App I removed it from the App Store as of now. The team is working to add functionality to the app which will become Version 2 of the app. Version 2 of the will be available in early to mid January. To still use and test the app, you can use the beta version using Testflight link above.
